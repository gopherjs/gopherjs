GopherJS - A transpiler from Go to JavaScript

### What is GopherJS?
GopherJS translates [Go code](http://golang.org/) to pure JavaScript code. Its main purpose is to give you the opportunity to write front-end code in Go which will still run in all browsers.

You can take advantage of Go's elegant type system and other compile-time checks that can have a huge impact on bug detection and the ability to refactor, especially for big projects. Just think of how often a JavaScript method has extra handling of some legacy parameter scheme, because you don't know exactly if some other code is still calling it in that old way or not. GopherJS will tell you and if it does not complain, you can be sure that this kind of bug is not present any more.

### Installation and Usage
Get GopherJS and dependencies with: 
```
go get github.com/neelance/gopherjs
```
Now you can use  `./bin/gopherjs build` and `./bin/gopherjs install` which behave similar to the `go` tool. The generated JavaScript files can be used as usual in a website.

*Note: GopherJS will try to write compiled object files of the core packages to your $GOROOT/pkg directory. If that fails, it will fall back to $GOPATH/pkg.*

If you want to run the generated code with Node.js instead, get the latest 0.11 release from [here](http://blog.nodejs.org/release/). Then compile and install a Node module that is required for syscalls (e.g. writing output to terminal):
```
npm install --global node-gyp
cd src/github.com/neelance/gopherjs/node-syscall/
node-gyp rebuild
mkdir -p ~/.node_libraries/
cp build/Release/syscall.node ~/.node_libraries/syscall.node
cd ../../../../../
```

### What is supported?
- all basic types, including 64-bit integers and complex numbers
- arrays, slices, maps and structures
- full type system with support for interfaces and type assertions
- reflection for all types
- many packages have been successfully tested, see [compatibility table](doc/packages.md)
- the transpiler can turn itself into pure JavaScript that runs in all major browsers

### Roadmap
These features are not implemented yet, but on the roadmap:

- optimizations of generated JavaScript code for improved output size and performance
- goroutines, channels, select
- goto
- output minification
- source maps

### Deviations from Go specification
Some tradeoffs had to be made in order to avoid huge performance impacts. Please get in contact if those are deal breakers for you.

- int and uint do not overflow, but have a maximum precision of 53 bits, after which rounding errors might occur (all other integer types have simulated overflow)
- float32 and complex64 have the same precision as float64 and complex128

### Interface to external JavaScript
A function's body can be written in JavaScript by putting the code in a string constant with the name `js_[function name]` for package functions and `js_[type name]_[method name]` for methods. In that case, GopherJS disregards the Go function body and instead generates `function(...) { [constant's value] }`. This allows functions to have a Go signature that the type checker can use while being able to call external JavaScript functions.
