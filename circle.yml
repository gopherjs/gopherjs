# CircleCI configuration for GopherJS.
#
# This configuration has one build_and_test workflow designed to run on all commits
# and pull requests. It consists of three jobs:
#
#  - build: Builds and runs GopherJS unit tests, as well as lits, smoke tests, etc.
#    This job is designed to provide quickest feedback on the most important
#    functionality. It should not include anything heavyweight and should be kept
#    under 2-3 minutes of runtime.
#
#  - gopherjs_tests: Runs standard library and GopherJS package tests using GopherJS
#    *itself*. This is the most comprehensive test suite we have and it is sharded
#    into 4 parallel instances for faster execution.
#
#  - gorepo_tests: Runs language tests from the Go compiler test suite. The objective
#    of these tests is to ensure conformance of GopherJS to the upstream Go to the
#    highest degree possible, considering differences in the runtime.
#
# If all tests passed, it is reasonably to assume that the version is more or less
# bug-free (although as of summer 2021 our test coverage is not ideal).
#
# For convenience of upgrades, NVM, Node.js and Go versions are specified as
# parameters at the top of the config. Increasing the version and ensuring that the
# workflow passes is sufficient to verify GopherJS compatibility with that version.
#
# Versions of Node modules GopherJS depends on are specified in package.json and can
# be changed there (remember to run `npm install` to update the lock file).
